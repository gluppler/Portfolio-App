                I'm a Computer Science student at Sunway University with a lifelong, hands-on passion for security that started 20 years ago. This deep experience in hardware, firmware, and physical systems is the foundation for my two platforms: <strong class="text-gray-800 dark:text-white">Behelit Systems</strong>, a security firm that secures the physical reality of businesses, and <strong class="text-gray-800 dark:text-white">Cult of the LOLCOW (cLc)</strong>, Malaysia's first open-source hardware hacking community.

                I'm driven by the challenge of understanding how systems break and using that knowledge to build more resilient defenses. I am currently seeking a strategic internship for 2026 to gain experience in large-scale corporate security operations, where I can contribute my deep, hands-on expertise to a team solving complex, real-world problems.
